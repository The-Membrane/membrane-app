# WELCOME TO THE BUNKER

*You found us. Good.*

Most people spend their entire lives being told what their money is worth by suits in distant towers. They accept the slow drain, the invisible tax, the monetary leash. You're here because you know there's another way. You know the game is rigged when your "money" is backed by guns and politicians instead of mathematics and code.

I'm your intro into this underground. This cyberpunk laboratory where the next generation of money is being forged in the digital fires. If you know, you know. And if you're reading this, you're ready to know.

## WHY WE BUILD

**The world's financial base layer is a weapon pointed at you.**

Fiat-denominated debt gives coercive control to governments and their bribed officials. Our money drains us for every last drop of life force while funding wars and enriching the already-powerful. We "supposedly" separated church and state. Now we separate state and money.

The hot new mass adoption crypto apps? Cool. But without a decentralized stablecoin, we're just onboarding people onto rails that enable MORE censorship. Bitcoin did something beautiful - it gave us indestructible energy, a foundation. But Bitcoin isn't the ship that crosses the raging seas. It's the fuel for the goliath that brings us to the next coastline.

**We need an exit. A 24/7 escape hatch that can grow into a new home.**

A home that's people-first, not country-first. Not politician-first. A currency that lives alongside us in synergy instead of parasitically. One that's neutral, indestructible, and liquid enough to actually use.

This isn't naive idealism. It's evolutionary inevitability.

From shells to gold-backed paper.  
From gold-backing to military-backing.  
From military-backing to Energetic-backing.  
**Membrane is inevitable.**

When the USD is worth more than the EUR, everything in Europe is cheaper for USD holders. "the world is cheaper for you.", is a great selling point. But now imagine that currency isn't controlled by any government, can't fund wars, and rewards YOU for contributing to its growth. That's not a dream. That's the blueprint.

**The reserve currency of the future doesn't fund wars. It funds freedom.**

## WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

**CDT: The Currency of Digital Territories.**

A Bitcoin-backed decentralized stablecoin designed to scale to reserve currency levels. Not a store-of-value that you HODL forever. A currency you USE. Every single day. An organism that grows stronger the more it's adopted, with transparent incentive systems that reward everyone who contributes.

CDT gives citizens an exit from bad monetary policy, from sharp repricing, from monetary chaos. It creates checks and balances for fiat by forcing currencies into realistic valuations. When governments can't earn the monetary premium from reserve status, they're forced to use the money printer efficiently instead of greedily.

**Better decentralized money = better fiat = better economies.**

But we're not just building a currency. We're building a bunker full of scientists, innovators, and early adopters. A hidden society providing intimate feedback to craft world-changing products. 

Positive feedback loops at all levels. Users make money, Builders are excited to build, everyone eats. And CDT strengthens as the emergent effect that spawns an indestructible currency.

**We're taking the politics out of money. The power stays in YOUR hands.**

## HOW IT WORKS: THE FLYWHEEL

Comprised of three interconnected venues that feed each other, this is the veModel coming to stablecoins for the first time. Membrane’s incentive design is as if Aerodrome was a stablecoin, but better.

### 1. THE TRANSMUTER
The gateway between worlds. Transmutes USDC to CDT and back. It gets funded by the **Transmuter Lockdrop** where users post USDC and opt for locks to increase their share of the MBRN allocation. The longer you lock, the bigger your stake in the new world.

### 2. MANIC LOOPER
Takes the USDC from the Transmuter and loops it into yielding positions on Mars Protocol for boosted yields. These looped stablecoin positions are longer-term plays that generate perpetual yields for the third venue. Efficiency multiplied.

### 3. LTV DISCO
Accepts MBRN deposits in vaults that decide the loan-to-value ratios for the entire protocol. These depositors get paid 100% of protocol revenue byr take on bad debt from the asset parameters they set. Risk, responsibility, reward. All aligned.

**The Result:** All value flows to MBRN while CDT liquidity and supply grow organically. Users earn. Builders build. The flywheel spins faster.

## THE ROADMAP: EVOLUTION IN PHASES

### PHASE 1: IGNITION
**Status: Active**
- Launch the Transmuter Lockdrop
- Bootstrap initial CDT supply and liquidity
- Deploy Manic Looper to Mars Protocol
- Activate LTV Disco 
- Programmatic rewards in MBRN for tangible contributions to the Membrane
- Bolster the bunker

**Growth Cap:** Limited by available USDC in Mars for yield boosting

### PHASE 2: EXPANSION
**Goal:** CDT earns its own listing on Mars Protocol
- Reach critical mass of CDT supply and liquidity
- Graduate from USDC-boosted positions to independent Mars integration
- Unlock new levels of capital efficiency
- Scale attribution affiliate and fee redistribution systems
- Onboard more venues to the flywheel

### PHASE 3: ASCENSION
**Goal:** Reserve currency status
- Multi-protocol integration across DeFi
- Cross-chain expansion
- Nation-level adoption metrics
- The world gets cheaper for CDT holders

### PHASE 4: FREEDOM
**Endgame:** A world where Luffy would be jealous
- CDT as the neutral global reserve currency
- Transparent governance by users who contribute
- Monetary premium separated from military power
- An exit available to every human on Earth
- The bunker becomes the foundation

## JOIN THE MEMBRANE

We've outlawed monopolies and yet our money is backed by guns. There's a disconnect. We're fixing it.

This is home to the scientists, the innovators, the rebels who refuse to be subservient. If you're allergic to unskilled authority, if you love efficient systems where everyone wins, if you believe money should serve humans instead of draining them—welcome home.

The bunker door is open. The experiments are running. The next generation of money is being crafted in real-time.

**You're early. You found us. Now let's build.**
